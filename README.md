Created by Johnathan Min to link the SBHS Website, Student Portal and Canvas together.
Other participating back-end developers will be added shortly, which may include Brendan Alcorn and other, currently unparticipating developers.
We aim to create a highly-efficient website which is able to map out the school and find the most congested corridors/areas during transition times.
